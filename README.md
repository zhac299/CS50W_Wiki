# CS50W_Wiki

My second project for CS50W. This project makes a page which is similar to Wikipedia. A user can register which then allows them to login. This then allows the user to create a wiki entry which is then saved to the database. The pages can be searched through via the search bar which allows the user to filter through pages which match their query. Furthermore, the page also converts any md (markdown) to html allowing pages to be formatted by the user who created the page).

Made with HTML, CSS, and Python (via Django)
